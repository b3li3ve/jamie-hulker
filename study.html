                <p class="scripture"><em>“And [Jesus] said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’  “This is the great and foremost commandment. “The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ (Matthew 22:38-39).</em></p>
                
                <p>At <strong><em>Jamie Hulker: Here for You</em></strong>, our goal is to help equip you to use your God-given design and giftings for His glory and others’ good. We believe this starts with personal time with God through studying about Who He is and His direction for our lives found in the Bible. We also believe that excellent resources are available to help guide and deepen your study.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, we put together some of our favorite resources and study methods. Our prayer and expectation is that the information you find here will help you get to know God better and understand His amazing love for you more completely, which will drive you to worship.</p>                
                
                <h3>Bible Studies</h3>
                <p>At <strong><em>Jamie Hulker: Here for You</em></strong>, our Bible studies are designed to help followers of Jesus, or those seeking to know more about Him, grow in their understanding of God and His love and grace for humanity. We offer two types of studies:</p>
                <h4>Our Studies are crafted to be</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Feasible:</strong> We recognize everyone is busy, so our studies are designed to fit your busy life.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Fulfilling:</strong> Our studies are informative and will guide you to a deeper understanding of God and how to follow Him.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun:</strong> We ensure our studies are interesting and provide a fun community!</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Esteemed</h4>
                <p>Imagine a Bible study that delves into the stories of women with the same depth typically reserved for other biblical narratives. Join us as we explore thirty-seven accounts of women from the Old and New Testaments and four stories from outside the Bible—women whom God esteemed by integrating them significantly into His plans and purposes for the world. These women were national leaders, deliverers, prophetesses, disciples, church planters, missionaries, mothers, and more! Their stories offer a biblically and historically grounded understanding of how God views women’s roles. By following God and serving Him and others out of their God-given design and giftings, these real women in real situations provide heroes and role models to follow. They also encourage women everywhere to use their own God-given designs and gifts for His glory and others’ good.</p>

                <h3>Our Recommendations</h3>
                <h4>The Bible</h4>
                <p>While there are a variety of translations, all of them fall into one of these three categories: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>Literal Translation</strong> of the Bible, also known as a <strong>word-for-word</strong> translation, is an approach to translating the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts into another language by staying as close as possible to the original wording, grammar, and sentence structure. The goal is to preserve the exact meaning of the original text, even if the resulting translation might sound a bit unnatural or awkward in the target language. (Recommended: <em>New American Standard</em>)</li>
                    <li>A <strong>Dynamic translation </strong>of the Bible, also known as a <strong>thought-for-thought translation</strong> or functional equivalence translation, prioritizes conveying the intended meaning of the original text in a way that is more natural and readable in the target language. These translations aim to communicate the original message while making it more accessible to modern readers, sometimes at the expense of sticking closely to the original word order or structure. (Recommended: <em>New Living Translation</em> or <em>New International Version</em>)</li>
                    <li>A <strong>Paraphrase</strong> of the Bible is a translation that rewords and rephrases the original text to convey its meaning in a way that is especially clear and accessible to contemporary readers. Unlike literal translations, which attempt to stick closely to the original wording, and dynamic translations, which balance accuracy with readability, a paraphrase focuses on re-expressing ideas and concepts to reflect modern language and culture. (Recommended: <em>The Message</em>).</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Amplified Version</strong> is a unique type of Bible translation that blends elements of both literal and dynamic translations. The <em>AMP</em> aims to enhance understanding by providing expanded translations of keywords and phrases directly within the text. (I highly recommend the <em>AMP</em> if you aren’t able to purchase other resources.)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Valuable Bible Study Tools: 
                </h3>
                <h4>Commentaries, Bible Dictionaries, Lexicons and Concordances                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commentaries</strong>: A book or series that provides verse-by-verse or passage-by-passage explanations and interpretations of the Bible. Commentaries offer historical, cultural, and theological insights from scholars. (Recommended for beginning Bible students: the New American Commentary, the NIV Application Commentary Series, and the Bible Knowledge Commentary. Recommended for more advanced study: The New International Commentary on the Old Testament (NICOT) and New Testament (NICNT)).</li>
                    <li><strong>Bible Dictionaries:</strong> A reference book that provides definitions and explanations of biblical terms, names, places, and concepts. It’s useful for understanding the background and meaning of specific words or topics. (Recommended: The Lexham Bible Dictionary and The New Unger's Bible Dictionary)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lexicons</strong>: A dictionary specifically for the original languages of the Bible—Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek—offering definitions, word usage, and grammatical information. It’s helpful for deep word studies. (Recommended: Vines Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words, and The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament).</li>
                    <li><strong>Concordance</strong>: An alphabetical index of words found in the Bible, showing where each word occurs and often providing the original Greek or Hebrew term. It's helpful for locating verses and studying word usage. (Recommended: Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The P-OIA Bible Study Method:
                </h4>
                <p>While there are other methods to help uncover biblical truths, the one to which we defer is the Inductive Bible Study Method. We’ve kept the method but changed the name to encourage us to always slow down enough to start each time in God’s Word with <strong>Prayer (P)</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>We’ve called this the P-OIA Method, and it includes prayer and three additional inductive Bible study steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>(O) Observation:</strong> determining what the Bible says.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(I) Interpretation:</strong> Determining what the Bible means by what it says.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(A) Application:</strong> Determining what the Bible means to us today. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
