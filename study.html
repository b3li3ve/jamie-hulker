                        <h4>Esteemed: God and His View of Women</h4>
                        <p>Imagine a Bible study that delves into the stories of women with the same depth typically reserved for other biblical narratives. Join us as we explore thirty-three accounts of women from the Old and New Testaments and four stories from outside the Bible—women whom God esteemed by integrating significantly into His plans and purposes for the world. These women were national leaders, deliverers, prophetesses, disciples, church planters, missionaries, mothers, and more! Their stories offer a biblically and historically grounded understanding of how God views women and women’s roles. By following God and serving Him and others out of their God-given design and giftings, these real women in real situations provide heroes and role models to follow. They also encourage women everywhere to use their own God-given designs and gifts for His glory and others’ good.</p>

                        <h4>The Bible</h4>
                        <p>While there are a variety of translations, all of them fall into one of these three categories:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A <strong>Literal Translation</strong> of the Bible, also known as a <strong>word-for-word</strong> translation, is an approach to translating the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts into another language by staying as close as possible to the original wording, grammar, and sentence structure. The goal is to preserve the exact meaning of the original text, even if the resulting translation might sound a bit unnatural or awkward in the target language. (Recommended: <em>New American Standard</em>)</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Dynamic translation </strong>of the Bible, also known as a <strong>thought-for-thought translation</strong> or functional equivalence translation, prioritizes conveying the intended meaning of the original text in a way that is more natural and readable in the target language. These translations aim to communicate the original message while making it more accessible to modern readers, sometimes at the expense of sticking closely to the original word order or structure. (Recommended: <em>New Living Translation</em> or <em>New International Version</em>)</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Paraphrase</strong> of the Bible is a translation that rewords and rephrases the original text to convey its meaning in a way that is especially clear and accessible to contemporary readers. Unlike literal translations, which attempt to stick closely to the original wording, and dynamic translations, which balance accuracy with readability, a paraphrase focuses on re-expressing ideas and concepts to reflect modern language and culture. (Recommended: <em>The Message</em>).</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Amplified Version</strong> is a unique type of Bible translation that blends elements of both literal and dynamic translations. The <em>AMP</em> aims to enhance understanding by providing expanded translations of keywords and phrases directly within the text (I highly recommend the <em>AMP</em> if you aren’t able to purchase other resources).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="tools">Valuable Bible Study Tools:
                        </h3>
                        <h4>Commentaries, Bible Dictionaries, Lexicons and Concordances                </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Commentaries</strong>: A book or series that provides verse-by-verse or passage-by-passage explanations and interpretations of the Bible. Commentaries offer historical, cultural, and theological insights from scholars. (Recommended for beginning Bible students: the <em>New American Commentary</em>, the <em>NIV Application Commentary Series</em>, and the <em>Bible Knowledge Commentary</em>. Recommended for more advanced study: The <em>New International Commentary on the Old Testament</em> (NICOT) and <em>New Testament</em> (NICNT)).</li>
                            <li><strong>Bible Dictionaries:</strong> A reference book that provides definitions and explanations of biblical terms, names, places, and concepts. It’s useful for understanding the background and meaning of specific words or topics. (Recommended: <em>The Lexham Bible Dictionary</em> and The <em>New Unger's Bible Dictionary</em>)
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Lexicons</strong>: A dictionary specifically for the original languages of the Bible—Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek—offering definitions, word usage, and grammatical information. It’s helpful for deep word studies. (Recommended: <em>Vines Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words</em>, and The <em>Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament</em>).</li>
                            <li><strong>Concordance</strong>: An alphabetical index of words found in the Bible, showing where each word occurs and often providing the original Greek or Hebrew term. It's helpful for locating verses and studying word usage. (Recommended: <em>Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible</em>)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>The Inductive Bible Study Method:
                        </h4>
                            <p>While other methods exist to help uncover biblical truths, we like the Inductive Bible Study Method because it allows us to explore the literal meaning of the original author’s words more accurately and apply them to our lives. We’ve added one preliminary step to this method to encourage us to always slow down enough to start our times in God’s Word with Prayer (P)</p>                        
                        
                            <p>Here are the three additional inductive Bible study steps:
                        </p>
                        <p>We’ve called this the P-OIA Method, and it includes prayer and three additional inductive Bible study steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>(O) Observation:</strong> determining what the Bible says.
