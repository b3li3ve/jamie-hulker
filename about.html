                <h2>What We believe</h2>
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Jamie Hulker: Here for You (JHH4Y) is a nondenominational discipleship ministry that believes in the following:</p>
                    <h3>THE FATHER</h3>
                    <p>The first person of the Trinity orders and directs all things according to His purpose and pleasure. He has created humanity to bring Him glory and honor through His grace. While He is transcendent, He is also actively involved in His creation—offering an eternal relationship with us through His Son, Jesus Christ. (Matthew 6:9; John 5:19-24; Ephesians 1:3-6; 2:1-10)</p>
                    <h3>THE SON</h3>
                    <p>Jesus Christ is both God's eternal Son and a virgin-born man. Fully God, fully man, He surrendered nothing of His deity during His earthly life. His sinless, sacrificial offering on the cross satisfied the Father’s justice, offering atonement for all of humanity’s sins for all time. We believe in His bodily resurrection, physical ascension, and visible return to earth to establish His earthly kingdom. (John 1:14-18; Colossians 1:15-20)
                    </p>
                    <h3>THE HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
                    <p>The Holy Spirit executes the will of God in this world by leading, guiding, filling, teaching, and convicting humanity. The Holy Spirit is not merely an impersonal force but is a person displaying the qualities of personhood (intellect, emotions, and will). The Holy Spirit equips believers, irrespective of gender, upon conversion by giving them gifts to be used for the building up of the church and by bearing fruit through their yielded lives. (John 16:7-11; Ephesians 2:10; Ephesians 1:13-14; Galatians 5:22-25)
                    </p>
                    <h3>HUMANITY</h3>
                    <p>We believe that mankind is created in the image of God and that together (male and female), they reflect that image. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We also believe that mankind is destined to enjoy an intimate relationship with God and with one another; however, because of Adam and Eve’s willful sin in the garden, sin entered the world and infected all of humanity. As a result, mankind was separated from God, spiritually dead, destined for physical death, and an eternity removed from God. (Genesis 1-3; Romans 1:18-32; Romans 5:12-21; Ephesians 2:1-3)
                    </p>
                    <h3>SALVATION</h3>
                    <p>We believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins as the only sufficient sacrifice that can offer atonement for the sins of mankind. Further, we believe that through His death, burial, and resurrection that salvation from the above referenced ramifications of sin is available to all who ask Him for that free gift accomplished only by the finished work of Christ on the cross. As a result of this new relationship with God through His Son, Jesus, we are called to a life of submission to the Holy Spirit, manifesting spiritual fruit, and walking in good works that God has prepared beforehand for us to do. (John 14:6; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; Ephesians 1:7, 2:8-9; Hebrews 10:10-14; 1 John 5:11-13; Galatians 3:26; John 3:16)
                    </p>
                    <h3>THE SCRIPTURES</h3>
                    <p>We believe every word in the original writings of the canonical Old and New Testaments is inspired by God and is without error in the original manuscripts. We affirm that God’s Word is accurate in all matters, infallible, and should be interpreted in its normal sense. We also affirm that while it reveals God’s nature and will for all of humanity and is the foundation and final authority for faith and practice, it is not given as an end in and of itself but rather a means to a relationship with God. (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Hebrews 4:12; John 17:17)
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the verbally inspired Word of God, the final authority for faith, life; and practice; infallible; and to be interpreted in their normal, literal sense. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21; Matt. 5:18; John 16:12-13.)
                    </p>
                    <h3>THE KINGDOM</h3>
                    <p>God promises to make all things new at the end of all things. He invites us, His followers, to join Him in this work of renewal on earth. The signs of His kingdom coming are salvation, joy, peace, justice, God’s presence, belonging, and healing. (Revelation 21:5)
                    </p>
                    <h3>NONESSENTIALS</h3>
                    <p>We affirm that the doctrines of the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the bodily resurrection, the atoning work of Christ on the cross, and salvation by grace through faith make up the essential, distinctive nature of Christianity. We acknowledge that there are peripheral, nonessential doctrines that are important to fellow believers but may not be critical to salvation. While we may hold positions on these nonessentials, we will not allow these doctrines to cause division within our ministry or with those we minister to or alongside.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>   Hi! I’m Jamie, and here’s a little bit about my story.   I grew up in the rural South, where my family faithfully attended church. There, I learned two foundational Biblical truths: Jesus died for my sins, and He will one day return. I accepted these truths at an early age and am deeply grateful for the eternal impact that church had on my life. However, these truths did not automatically shield me from the challenges of being an adventurous, independent, and somewhat rebellious teenager and young adult. Something was missing, and thankfully, God didn’t leave me wandering there for long.
                </p>
                    <p>   In college, through the influence of Christian friends, a college ministry, and a Bible-teaching church, I discovered that the Word of God, prayer, and Christian community are vital to the lives of Jesus’ followers. I realized that all three are necessary for walking as His disciples—exactly what I had been missing!
                    </p>
                    <p>   My adult life has been devoted to pursuing these three essentials, and in that pursuit, I’ve had the blessing of serving in full-time ministry, on church staff, and as a lay volunteer. During this time, I have traveled to over 30 countries on six continents, sharing the Good News about Jesus and teaching what it means to walk as His disciples. I have also written and taught Bible studies, organized conferences, and led events closer to home focused on these three Christian disciplines.
                    </p>
                    <p>   I’m also a research nerd who recently put that passion to good work by earning an MA in Ministry. This further enhanced my love for studying the Scriptures through the historical-grammatical method, which informs everything I write and teach. Coupled with my life experiences, this enables me to translate biblical truth into everyday language, helping others grasp the depth of that truth for themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>   The ministry of Jamie Hulker: Here for You flows out of this lifetime of learning and serving God, and we are intentional about encouraging, equipping, and engaging others. As a sister in Christ, author, Bible teacher, International Study guide, and Mission Team Leader, my heart is to leverage my seasoned experience to provide well-researched resources, opportunities, and inspiration that authentically impact lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>   I live in Franklin, TN, with my husband and two dogs, and I’m a proud new grandmother! I love my family, being part of a diverse community, learning from others, and creating meaningful interactions. I currently teach at my home church, speak at local events, and love meeting for coffee to discuss the Bible and its impact on our lives. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling anywhere and hiking everywhere. I’m also an aspiring sprint triathlete.
                    </p>
                    <p>   Additionally, I deeply value unity in the Church. Some of Jesus' last words were a prayer for Christian unity (John 17), and last words are never wasted on unimportant matters. While I stand unapologetically on biblical truth, I will never seek to divide or push an agenda that is not essential to the Christian faith. It is my prayer that this approach will help bring healing and unity within the Church.

                    </p>
