            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>   Hi! I’m Jamie, and here’s a little bit about my story.   I grew up in the rural South, where my family faithfully attended church. There, I learned two foundational Biblical truths: Jesus died for my sins, and He will one day return. I accepted these truths at an early age and am deeply grateful for the eternal impact that church had on my life. However, these truths did not automatically shield me from the challenges of being an adventurous, independent, and somewhat rebellious teenager and young adult. Something was missing, and thankfully, God didn’t leave me wandering there for long.
                </p>
                    <p>   In college, through the influence of Christian friends, a college ministry, and a Bible-teaching church, I discovered that the Word of God, prayer, and Christian community are vital to the lives of Jesus’ followers. I realized that all three are necessary for walking as His disciples—exactly what I had been missing!
                    </p>
                    <p>   My adult life has been devoted to pursuing these three essentials, and in that pursuit, I’ve had the blessing of serving in full-time ministry, on church staff, and as a lay volunteer. During this time, I have traveled to over 30 countries on six continents, sharing the Good News about Jesus and teaching what it means to walk as His disciples. I have also written and taught Bible studies, organized conferences, and led events closer to home focused on these three Christian disciplines.
                    </p>
                    <p>   I’m also a research nerd who recently put that passion to good work by earning an MA in Ministry. This further enhanced my love for studying the Scriptures through the historical-grammatical method, which informs everything I write and teach. Coupled with my life experiences, this enables me to translate biblical truth into everyday language, helping others grasp the depth of that truth for themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>   The ministry of Jamie Hulker: Here for You flows out of this lifetime of learning and serving God, and we are intentional about encouraging, equipping, and engaging others. As a sister in Christ, author, Bible teacher, International Study guide, and Mission Team Leader, my heart is to leverage my seasoned experience to provide well-researched resources, opportunities, and inspiration that authentically impact lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>   I live in Franklin, TN, with my husband and two dogs, and I’m a proud new grandmother! I love my family, being part of a diverse community, learning from others, and creating meaningful interactions. I currently teach at my home church, speak at local events, and love meeting for coffee to discuss the Bible and its impact on our lives. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling anywhere and hiking everywhere. I’m also an aspiring sprint triathlete.
                    </p>
                    <p>   Additionally, I deeply value unity in the Church. Some of Jesus' last words were a prayer for Christian unity (John 17), and last words are never wasted on unimportant matters. While I stand unapologetically on biblical truth, I will never seek to divide or push an agenda that is not essential to the Christian faith. It is my prayer that this approach will help bring healing and unity within the Church.

                    </p>
