            <div class="text-content">
                <p>“And [Jesus] said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’  “This is the great and foremost commandment. “The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ (Matthew 22:38-39).</p>
                
                <p>At Jamie Hulker: Here for You, we recognize that many Christians are passionate about loving God with all their hearts, and we’re grateful for the abundance of resources available to support that aspect of faith. However, we’ve found that it’s less common to find accessible resources that engage the mind and delve into the deep, historical, cultural, and biblical truths of God’s Word.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that understanding Scripture shouldn’t require a seminary education. As 2 Timothy 3:16-17 reminds us, “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” This passage emphasizes that every believer can—and should—study the Scriptures diligently and excellently.</p>
                
                <p>With this in mind, check out these resources to help you grow as a disciple of Jesus. They make profound biblical truths accessible and practical for all. Our prayer and expectations are that the things you find here will help you identify and respond to areas of personal and family needs with the certain hope of grace and empowerment from God.</p>
