            <h1>Messy to Marvelous—Mosaics in Motion</h1>
            <p>Mosaics fascinate me! The intricacies and beauty of the work, not to mention the sheer amount of time, dedication, and hard work required of the artist to create something meaningful and beautiful out of all those tiny little pieces, leave me in awe. Whether it’s mosaic tiles in a bathroom or kitchen (I know, I’m weird!), a massive iconic work by a renowned artist, or anything in between, I’m drawn to them.</p>

            <p>Bryan and I found ourselves in Barcelona, Spain, a few years ago. On a bit of a whim, we decided to visit Park Güell. Now, we’re not exactly what you’d call “art aficionados,” and we were just learning about Antoni Gaudi, the famous architect who built Park Güell, so we had no idea what awaited us. But after experiencing it, I completely agree with the description I later found on a website:</p>

            <p>“In Park Güell, architecture and nature merge in a breathtaking way. Immerse yourself in an incomparable masterpiece by Antoni Gaudí. Magical gardens, mysterious paths, and colorful mosaics invite you to take a fascinating walk. Let yourself be enchanted by the unique vision of one of the greatest architects in history and experience a place full of vibrant atmosphere and creative design.”</p>

            <p>The park is indeed everything Barcelona.de described. The scope of work required from Gaudi must have been astronomical, but the results were truly something to behold!</p>

            <p>One area of the park that captivated me was the esplanade. From this vantage point, you get one of the best views of Barcelona. But the bench on the esplanade from which you can take in this breathtaking view impressed me even more. The bench has an unusual profile built around its edge and is covered in... Can you guess? Mosaics! As I took in the scene and admired the beauty, our guide, as a side note, mentioned that the pieces Gaudí used to create the mosaics on the bench were “discarded or unused glazed ceramics or tiles that he broke into pieces.” He went on to say something about how these mosaic fragments, all different colors and textures, remarkably enlivened what would otherwise be a simple bench.</p>

            <p>As I sat there, listening and looking around, I realized the guide’s casual remarks resonated with me deeply. What an extraordinary, tangible display of my life, with all its broken, unused, or discarded pieces and the astronomical amount of work God, the Master Architect, has carefully and painstakingly dedicated to enlivening the mess that had been (and sometimes still is), my life. It all became so clear to me in a new way. To say I was grateful that day for this picture of how God has worked and continues to work things together for good (Romans 8:28) is an understatement. While it’s so tempting to just see the mess, the broken, discarded, or unused parts of our lives, and readily forget them and move on, Gaudi didn’t, and he created an unforgettable bench. God doesn’t forget or move on either, and much more than an unforgettable bench, He creates an unforgettable you and me! What an amazing truth! What an amazing God!</p>

            <p>I don’t think I’ll ever forget the insight God gave me that day or the privilege of learning such an important truth in this beautiful, and now, to me, very much meaningful place. Even though Park Güell was a last-minute addition to our trip, it just might be one of my all-time favorite places we’ve visited.</p>

            <p>Here are some pics of the bench and one of us on that famous bench…</p>

            <p>Have you ever thought about how mosaics mirror our lives? If so, I’d love to hear about it! And if not, does the idea resonate with you now? Please share—I’m always eager to learn from others!</p>
