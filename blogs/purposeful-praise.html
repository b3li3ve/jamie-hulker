        <h1>Singing in the Dark: Purposeful Psalms From Paul and Silas</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>For many Christians, the Book of Psalms (also known as the Psalter) is a favorite in the Bible—and understandably so. The book we call the Psalms is actually a collection of five books, each ending with a brief doxology (Psalms 41:13, 72:19, 89:52, 106:48). Psalm 150 pulls together all these doxologies in a powerful grand finale that doesn’t just encourage us but exhorts us to praise God!</p>

        <p>In just six short verses, the word “praise” appears 13 times in Psalm 150, commanding us repeatedly to “praise the Lord.” William Varner, in his devotional <em>Awake O Harp</em>, describes Psalm 150 as “genius” in “how much it says with so few words.” I have come to love the Psalms for this very reason—they speak profound truths in simple, powerful language.</p>

        <p>But let’s be honest: sometimes, it’s challenging to offer praise to God, especially when the circumstances of our lives are difficult or differ from what we’ve hoped or expected.</p>

        <p>Today, while studying the timeline of the Apostle Paul’s life, I came across a picture of the Philippian jail (above) where Paul and Silas were said to have been held. It struck me in a new way that this jail is most likely where they followed the exhortation of Psalm 150 and sang praise to God in their own difficult situation that was quite different from what they’d hoped for.</p>

        <p>This story, found in Acts 16, is somewhat familiar to many. The short version is that the Spirit directed Paul to take the Gospel to Macedonia through a vision, which he did, along with Silas, his missionary partner. Their first stop on their new route (directed by God, remember) was the city of Philippi. There, they met a demon-possessed slave girl who followed them around, repeatedly crying out, “These men are bondservants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation” (v. 17). Apparently, Paul became annoyed—perhaps not only with the repetition but also with the torment this girl endured at the hands of the demon and those who exploited her for profit (but that’s a topic for another blog!).</p>

        <p>Anyway, Paul commanded the demon to leave her in the name of Jesus, and it did—taking with it any hope for continued profit for those to whom the girl was enslaved. As a result, Paul and Silas were beaten and thrown in jail. The Bible says they were placed “in the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks” (v. 24).</p>

        <p>The entire story is quite disturbing on numerous levels, but today, I want to focus on what happened next.</p>

        <blockquote>“But about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them” (Acts 16:25, NASB 95).</blockquote>

        <p>Amazing, isn’t it? Paul and Silas, likely naked, definitely beaten, and bound in stocks in the inner prison, were praying and singing hymns of praise (vv. 22-25). Have you ever wondered what songs they were singing? I hadn’t until today. I discovered that some scholars believe they might have been singing from the Hallel Psalms (Psalms 113-118), which are rich with praise. Consider these lines from Psalm 113:1-9 (MSG):</p>

        <blockquote>
            Hallelujah!<br>
            You who serve GOD, praise GOD!<br>
            Just to speak his name is praise!<br>
            Just to remember GOD is a blessing—<br>
            now and tomorrow and always.<br>
            From east to west, from dawn to dusk,<br>
            keep lifting all your praises to GOD!<br>
            GOD is higher than anything and anyone,<br>
            outshining everything you can see in the skies.<br>
            Who can compare with GOD, our God,<br>
            so majestically enthroned,<br>
            surveying his magnificent<br>
            heavens and earth?<br>
        </blockquote>

        <p>With all this swirling around in my mind, we left for church, where I quickly discovered that God wasn’t finished speaking to me through this story! The first song we sang was <em>Worthy of It All</em>. Here’s the chorus:</p>

        <blockquote>
            You are worthy of it all<br>
            You are worthy of it all<br>
            For from You are all things<br>
            And to You are all things<br>
            You deserve the glory.<br>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The second song we sang was <em>Holy Forever</em>. Check out these lyrics:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Your name is the highest<br>
            Your name is the greatest<br>
            Your name stands above them all<br>
            All thrones and dominions<br>
            All powers and positions<br>
            Your name stands above them all<br>
            And the angels cry, “Holy”<br>
            All creation cries, “Holy”<br>
            You are lifted high, holy<br>
            Holy forever.<br>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Singing these songs from the comfort of an air-conditioned room, surrounded by other Christians and talented musicians, and without any immediate threat, I was struck again, this time, by the contrast between my situation and that of Paul and Silas. They had none of these comforts—in fact, they were experiencing the exact opposite—yet they were singing praise to God. To say I was convicted might be an understatement. Do I praise God despite my circumstances? Not always.</p>

        <p>Why did Paul and Silas? Why did they praise God in this dark, hard, humiliating, and unexpected place? Better yet, how could they sing such praises in that situation?</p>

        <p>It all came together for me when I read Psalm 150. I believe they were following the exhortation of Psalm 150 (which they would have known from their Jewish backgrounds)! As Paul and Silas sang what they knew to be true about God in this difficult place, I’m sure it bolstered their minds and hearts and gave them peace and hope. Moreover, the other prisoners were listening (Acts 16:25). I believe this note was given to us to show us that Paul and Silas’s response to their suffering didn’t just impact their own hearts—it impacted everyone around them.</p>

        <p>So, what can we take from this story? Lots. But here’s my three takeaways today:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>God is Sovereign and can be trusted—even when circumstances aren’t what we expected and seem hopeless.</li>
            <li>Sing songs of praise to God, no matter the circumstances—because you never know how your response will impact your own mind and heart, and the minds and hearts of those around you, both now and in the future.</li>
            <li>Paul and Silas's response wasn’t feigned or faked. Paul and Silas’s trust in God was legit, hence the singing. Their trust stemmed from lives rooted and grounded in knowing who God is through their knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures. Furthermore, I am persuaded this deep understanding of God fueled all their praise songs regardless—even when
