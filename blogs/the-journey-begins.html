            <h1>The Journey Begins…</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Jamie. Welcome to my first blog post! As I sit down to write, I’m struck by how fitting it is to title this post “The Journey Begins.” While my journey with Jesus started years ago, this blog marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life and ministry—a chapter I get to share with you, and I’m very excited about that!</p>

            <p>My journey began as a Southern girl whose family faithfully attended church. There, I first learned two foundational truths: Jesus died for my sins, and He will one day return. These truths, though seemingly simple, laid the groundwork for my faith. I accepted them at an early age, and I am deeply grateful for that. But, like many, my path wasn’t always straight or easy. As I navigated the challenges of being an adventurous, independent, and sometimes just straight-up rebellious teenager and young adult, I realized something crucial was missing.</p>

            <p>It wasn’t until college that I discovered what I had been missing—a deeper understanding of what it means to truly follow Jesus. Through the influence of Christian friends, a vibrant college ministry, a Bible-teaching church, and Godly mentors, I came to understand the importance of three essentials: the Word of God, Prayer, and Christian community. These elements became the cornerstone of my walk with Christ and transformed my life in ways I could never have imagined.</p>

            <p>Post-college, my journey has taken me to over 30 countries on six continents, and sometimes literally just across the street, sharing the Good News of Jesus and helping others discover what it means to walk as His disciples. Whether through serving in full-time ministry, writing and teaching Bible studies, being a part of church leadership, or simply being a sister in Christ, my passion has always been to encourage and equip others to grow in their faith.</p>

            <p>Jamie Hulker: Here for You will be a ministry that flows from this foundation. The ministry's tagline, “Here for You,” carries a double meaning—on the one hand, it represents my commitment to being present for you, my fellow sojourner, as we navigate our journeys of faith together. On the other hand, it underscores the idea that the ultimate purpose behind it all is to honor and glorify God.</p>

            <p>As I embark on this new chapter, I invite you to join me. Whether you’re here to learn, to be encouraged, or simply to connect with someone who shares your passion for faith, I’m glad you’re here. Together, we can explore what it means to walk in His footsteps, live out our faith in community, and pursue the unity Christ so deeply desires for His Church.</p>

            <p>So, welcome to the beginning of this new journey. I’m excited to see where God will lead us!</p>
